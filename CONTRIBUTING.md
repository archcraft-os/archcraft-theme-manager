## Creating a theme

Creating a theme is relatively simple and most people should be able to make one with ease.

To start, you must create a directory in `~/.config/openbox-themes/themes/{your-theme-name-here}`.
> If you would like, you could also copy another theme into a different directory so as the base of the theme is already there.
